# Spotify Popular Tracks Features Report

## Introduction	
The project analyzes a dataset sourced from Kaggle (Link), which has been compiled from Spotify. This dataset includes both popular and non-popular songs, along with their corresponding audio and descriptive features. Analyzing this data could offer valuable insights into the characteristics that contribute to a song's popularity. Such information would be instrumental for Spotify musicians in crafting tracks with greater potential for success and provide the marketing team with actionable data for strategic decision-making. 

## Business Impact
By exploring this data, Spotify could gain valuable insights that help guide better decisions. It would help identify the key features that make a song popular and highlight the most popular genres. Ultimately, these insights would help Spotify understand its audience and market trends more clearly, supporting smarter decisions for both content creation and marketing strategies.

## Data Analysis
### Data Cleaning
1. Combined both datasets as one dataset.
2. Deleted some columns because they are not useful for this analysis: track_href, uri, type, playlist_id, analysis_url, track_album_id, id.
3. Deleted every record that has missing inputs, which are only 5 records.
4. Converted loudness to a positive value, because disable unit cannot be represented as a negative value.
5. Converted duration (duration_ms) from milliseconds to seconds so it can be more understandable.
6. The data does not need further curation because it is generated by machine and has minimum errors, and many columns will not be used in the analyses.
### Analysis Methods

## Conclusion
Popular tracks on Spotify tend to have certain characteristics that make them widely appealing. They are generally 214 seconds (around 3.5 minutes) long, striking a balance between engagement and attention retention. These tracks are often from genres like Pop, R&B, Gaming, Metal, Punk, K-pop, Rock, Hip-hop, and Electronic, which are energetic and have broad appeal. The most popular subgenres, such as global, mainstream, soft, throwback, and 80s, indicate a preference for both contemporary and nostalgic sounds. These tracks typically have a higher energy score (0.667), making them lively and danceable, with an average tempo of 121 BPM, providing an upbeat yet approachable rhythm. Additionally, they feature more vocals than instrumental parts, allowing for a stronger emotional connection with listeners through catchy lyrics. The overall mood of popular tracks is often happier, evoking positive feelings and making them ideal for social or energetic settings. This combination of upbeat energy, memorable lyrics, danceability, and a moderate tempo makes these tracks highly engaging, ensuring they appeal to a broad audience.

## Future Works
Further exploration of this topic could benefit from a much larger and more diverse dataset, potentially including data from different platforms beyond Spotify, to get a broader understanding of what makes a track popular across various listener groups. This could help identify trends that are consistent across platforms or unique to specific ones. Additionally, incorporating listener opinions through surveys, reviews, or engagement metrics could provide valuable insights, as the features of the tracks studied here are largely machine-generated. While the current dataset provides useful, data-driven insights into track characteristics like energy, tempo, and genre, listener preferences and subjective experiences could add depth to the analysis.
